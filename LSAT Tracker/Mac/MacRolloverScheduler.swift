/// - the machine waking from sleep (a boundary may have passed while asleep,
///   and a sleeping Mac does not fire timers);
/// - any of the app's windows becoming key — the main window or the popover
///   panel — so what the user sees is fresh the moment they look.

/// Clock or time-zone changes re-arm the boundary timer, since the wall-clock
